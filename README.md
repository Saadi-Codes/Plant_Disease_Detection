## ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection Web App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that uses a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the **New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)** from Kaggle.

---

## Features

- Upload a leaf image (JPG, PNG) from given test images
- Predict plant disease using a deep learning model
- Shows top prediction with class name
- Clean UI with real-time results
